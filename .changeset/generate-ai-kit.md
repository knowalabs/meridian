New `devpilot generate` command: produce the complete AI kit for a project — canonical rules (propagated to every tool), Claude Code subagents, skills, slash commands, reusable prompts and AI onboarding docs — tailored to the codebase by the routed AI provider, with static fallbacks so it also works fully offline. Includes `--dry-run`, `--force`, `--no-ai`, `--provider`, per-kind selection and `--json`. Also upgrades vitest to v4 (fixing the lint break the Dependabot bumps hit) and clears the brace-expansion audit advisory.

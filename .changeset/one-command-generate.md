One command to make a project AI-ready: `devpilot generate` now reviews the codebase first and produces everything in a single run — scaffold, `context.md`, `architecture.md`, rules (mirrored to every tool), subagents, skills, slash commands, prompts and onboarding docs. The separate `init`, `scan` and `rules` commands are gone; their functionality is folded into `generate`. Generated content is much richer: a deeper codebase digest for AI tailoring, and static fallbacks now derive real module boundaries, verification chains and workflows from the code instead of generic templates.
